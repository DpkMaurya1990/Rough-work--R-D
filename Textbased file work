Textbased files are those files which allow copy of data from pdf files.
Textbased pdf files allow us to extract the data from pdf files.
We can extact the text from PDF files by using 2 python libraries which are (A) PyPDF (B) PYmuPDF

# importing required modules
from pypdf import PdfReader

# creating a pdf reader object
reader = PdfReader('example.pdf')

# printing number of pages in pdf file
print(len(reader.pages))

# getting a specific page from the pdf file
page = reader.pages[0]

# extracting text from page
text = page.extract_text()
print(text)

Let understand each code
Example 1st : reader = PdfReader('example.pdf')
(A) We have created an object called Pdfreader from the class Pypdf which is called module
(B) PdfReader class takes the required positional argument of the path to the file


"In Python, a library is a collection of modules, while a module is a single file that contains code. 
Libraries are used to provide functionality, while modules are the building blocks of libraries. "

Example 2nd:  print.len(reader.pages))
Pages is the property give the list of the pageObjects. So here we can use the in-built function of python to get number of pages in the PDF.
